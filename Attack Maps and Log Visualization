Log into the Azure Portal
Go to Sentinel → Threat Management → Workbooks → Add a Workbook.

We are going to use all the logs being created within our environment (some frome students, some from bad actors on the internet) to create world map visualization workbooks for the following scenarios based on originating IP address just to give a visualization of what’s happening in the network:

Entra ID (Azure) Authentication Success https://github.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/blob/main/cyber-range/sentinel/Directory-Login-Successes.json

Entra ID (Azure) Authentication Failures https://github.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/blob/main/cyber-range/sentinel/Directory-Login-Failures.json

Azure Resource Creation https://github.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/blob/main/cyber-range/sentinel/Azure-Resource-Creation.json

VM Authentication Failures https://github.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/blob/main/cyber-range/sentinel/VM-Authentication-Failures.json

Malicious Traffic Entering the Network https://github.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/blob/main/cyber-range/sentinel/Allowed-Inbound-Malicious-Flows.json

Bear in mind we are only creating a few of these. You can create maps like this for literally anything. It just depends on what is important to your organization and what you want to see.
